## Inspiration
- Marketplaces like Opensea are not Completely trustless.
- NFTs created using Opensea exists on Opensea StoreFront Contract which is closed source.
- Setting up Snapshot, Discourse and DAO infrastructure is cumbersome.

## What it does
- DAOMe is a No-Code Creator Economy Platform.
- DAOMe solves this problem all the NFTs created on the DAOMe Platform all 100% owned by the creator.
- DAOMe solves all this problems by providing a No-Code solution and making Web3 more accessible to the masses.

## How I built it
- DAOMe is built using ReactJS Frontend and Celo Blockchain Smart Contracts as Backend. 
- I used Hardhat as a testing and development environment.
